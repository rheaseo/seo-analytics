Weekly Change
I encountered an issue with the percentage change calculations for metrics where both values are zero (Total Purchases, Average Revenue per Purchase, and Total Revenue). Division by zero results in "NaN," which means the percentage change is not applicable (N/A) in these cases. Here's the updated table with the calculated percentage changes:

Metric	Last 7 Days	Previous Week	Percentage Change
Total Page Views	473	399	18.55%
Total Users	337	307	9.77%
Total Sessions	397	356	11.52%
Average Sessions per User	1.3313087407019109	1.2876829717973528	3.39%
Average Session Duration	172.07530523131118	156.05062811005746	10.27%
Total Purchases	0	0	N/A
Average Revenue per Purchase	0	0	N/A
Total Revenue	0	0	N/A
Monthly Change
The analysis reveals a general decline in key metrics such as page views, users, and sessions over the last 30 days compared to the previous 60 days, indicating reduced engagement. Average session duration saw a slight decrease, while metrics related to purchases and revenue remain at zero with no change.

Metric	Last 30 Days	Previous 60 Days	Percentage Change
Total Page Views	1708	2705	-36.9%
Total Users	1259	1851	-32.0%
Total Sessions	1476	2145	-31.2%
Average Sessions per User	1.31	1.31	0.0%
Average Session Duration	2.5 min	2.6 min	-3.9%
Total Purchases	0	0	0%
Average Revenue per Purchase	$0	$0	0%
Total Revenue	$0	$0	0%
